Chingu Voyage 8 prework

[demo](https://nikrb-chingu-voyage8-prework.glitch.me/)

This application should allow you to:
* Enter a query in a search box
* Display a list of books matching the given query.
* Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
* From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
